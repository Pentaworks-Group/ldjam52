   - "Q" to quit dialog
 - Improve "Rename" visiblity for crops
 - Small random variation on crops harvest

Ideas:
----------------------------------
 - Increase map size (Generate extra tiles)
 - Field purchase limitations 
   - Add road tile & fields only available if 3 tiles from next road
   - Only buy adjacent tiles
 - Rotten fields
 - Rotate camera
 - Pan using the camera angle to the grid
 - Fertilizer
 - Tutorial (Maybe add a scene on first start)
 - Add "New version available" text to game (link to Itch.io or similar).
 - Highlight selected fields
 - Group fields
 - Auto harvest & replant (for money?)
 - Pitch sound effects (to increase the "variety" in  effects)
